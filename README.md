   - [X] Dragging anywhere in the view should reveal the menu.
   - [X] The menu should include links to your profile, the home timeline, and the mentions view.
   - [X] The menu can look similar to the example or feel free to take liberty with the UI.

   - [X] Contains the user header view
   - [X] Contains a section with the users basic stats: # tweets, # following, # followers

The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes

Would have to loved to have a better understanding about NIBs and duplicating cells. I think that this could have saved a significant amount of time. My mind was also kind of blown that you could put other items into a TableView. 

I didn't have enough time to handle account management but I think this would be an interesting topic.
